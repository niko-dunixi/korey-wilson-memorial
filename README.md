You will never know how many people you touched. How many people you brought together to celebrate the love we have for you. Your funeral was beautiful. Many people came. I was honored to be a pallbearer. [I will never be the same again](https://www.facebook.com/paulbakersaltshaker/posts/10156774872367328). I will never forget you. My friend, my brother, _my cousin_, Korey Wilson.
